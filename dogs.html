        <h1>Our Dog Care</h1>
        <p
          >The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse
          variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the
          World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
          between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having
          a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from
          adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced
          blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. If you have a dog, it is
          important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what
          you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In
          this page, you will find more information about how to care for your
          pets throughout the various stages of their lives.</p

          <h1 class="banner-heading">Diet and Exercise</h1>
          <p class="banner-desc"
            >Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer
            meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months,
            then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to
            six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two
            meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally
            reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s
            typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent
            water. The ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can
            cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure
            you keep your pooch hydrated! Much like humans, dogs need to have a
            healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as
            sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies
            greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of
            30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine
            exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some
            of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe!
            And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are challenged
            to a pushup contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose
            from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure
            they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay
            careful attention to toys that require supervision.</p

          <p class="banner-desc"
            >Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
            So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and
            prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
            difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
            especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
            important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on
            how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any
            residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated
            for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic
            reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one.
            No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry
            your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one
            hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it
            is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms
            perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
            rear as you lift.</p

            >This age is when kittens reach the cat stage & do not need as many
            nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so
            does their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for
            the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day they
            eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice
            reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline
            ailments.</p
